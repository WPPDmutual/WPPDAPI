# WPPDAPI


Out in the country, far from a highway

There is this land here, and it is my way

Don't ever come here, or you'll be sorry

This land was made just for me


This land is my land, it isn't your land

I got a shotgun, and you don't got none

If you don't get off, I'll blow your head off

This land was made just for me


So keep away now, Don't ruin my day now

My property's private, you cannot buy it

Go find your own land, Just be a lone man

This land was made just for me


This land is my land, it isn't your land

I got a shotgun, and you don't got none

If you don't get off, I'll blow your head off

This land was made just for me
